ML
---------------
-ML is a method of Data Analysis that automates analytical model building.
-Using algos that iteratively learn from data, ML allows computers to find hidden insights 
without being explicitly programmed where to look.

Data Acquisition --> Data Cleaning -->

----------------
Supervised --> Labeled Data --> Predict a label based on known features
----------------
-algos are trained using labeled examples
-input where desired output is known

- Through methods like Classification, Regression, Prediction and Gradient Boosting, it uses patterns to predict values of labels on unlabeled data

- Commonly used in apps where historical data predicts likely future events
-> Ex Fraud Card activities 

----------------
Unsupervised --> Unlabeled Data --> Trying to group together similar data points based on features
----------------
-It is used against the data that has no historical labels
-System has no right answer. Algo must figure it out.
- Goal is to explore data and find some structure within.
- Or it can find the main attributes that seperate customer segments from each other.
- Also used to segment text topics
-----------------------
Reinforcement Learning --> Algo learns to perform action from experience
-----------------------
- often used in robotics, gaming and navigation.
- algo discovers through trial and error which actions yeild the greatest rewards.

Components:
-Agent -- Learner or Decision Maker
-Environment -- everything agent interacts with
-Actions -- what agent can do

-Objective for agent to choose actions that maximize the expected reward over given amount of time.
-Agent will reach the goal much faster by following a good policy.
-Goal is to learn best policy.
